# Media Restructuring Implementation Summary

## Completed Implementation

1. **Added an Alembic migration** (`c0debb123456_add_media_restructuring_columns.py`)
   - Added new columns to the Media table:
     - `archive_source`: To track the source archive
     - `relative_path`: For path relative to the media root 
     - `original_path`: To store the original file path
   - Created indexes for `original_file_id` and `checksum`

2. **Created a media restructuring script** (`src/carchive/scripts/media_restructure.py`)
   - Implements file finding across multiple archives
   - Copies files to the new directory structure
   - Updates database records with new path information
   - Handles batching for large migrations
   - Provides detailed statistics and logging

3. **Updated the ChatGPT adapter** (`src/carchive/migration/chatgpt_adapter.py`)
   - Modified to preserve original filenames during import
   - Updated to use archive-specific subdirectories
   - Enhanced to store complete path information in the database

4. **Updated the Media API routing** (`src/carchive/api/routes/media.py`)
   - Added support for the new file structure
   - Implemented a prioritized search mechanism
   - Maintained backward compatibility

5. **Added a new CLI command** to the media CLI
   - `carchive media restructure`: Command to run the media restructuring with various options
   - Provides both dry-run and actual migration capability

6. **Created helper scripts and documentation**
   - `apply_media_restructure.sh`: For running the full migration process
   - `verify_media_restructure.py`: For validating the migration results
   - Comprehensive documentation in `media_restructure_README.md`

## Migration Process

The implemented migration follows this workflow:

1. Run the Alembic migration to add necessary database columns
2. Create the new directory structure
3. Run a dry-run of the migration to preview changes
4. Perform the actual migration after confirmation
5. Verify the migration with comprehensive checks:
   - Database record updates
   - File accessibility through the API
   - Message-media association integrity
6. Update configuration to use the new structure

## Key Features

1. **Complete Backward Compatibility**
   - Files can still be found in their original locations if needed
   - Enhanced path resolution with prioritized search algorithm
   - Graceful fallback to alternate archives

2. **Improved Traceability**
   - Original file IDs preserved and indexed
   - Archive source tracked to know where each file originated
   - Original paths stored for reference

3. **Clean Directory Organization**
   - Files organized by source archive
   - Original filenames preserved
   - Clear separation between different types of media

4. **Verification and Validation**
   - Comprehensive verification tools
   - Detailed logging and reporting
   - Easy rollback path if needed

The implementation ensures a smooth transition to the new media structure while maintaining full backward compatibility and data integrity.
