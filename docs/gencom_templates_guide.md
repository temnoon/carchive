# Gencom Templates Guide

This document explains the templates and system prompts used in the gencom system.

## Overview

The gencom system now uses specialized system prompts and templates for different output types. Each template includes:

1. A **system prompt** that defines the agent's role and constraints
2. A **task-specific prompt** that describes the specific task to perform
3. A **content placeholder** where the actual content is inserted

## Template Structure

Templates follow this structure:

```
<|system|>
You are a specialized [Type] Agent. Your only task is to [description of role and constraints]...
</|system|>

<|user|>
[Task-specific prompt]: 

{content}
</|user|>

<|assistant|>
```

Where:
- The `<|system|>` section defines the agent's role and behavior
- The `<|user|>` section contains the task instruction and content
- The `{content}` placeholder is where the message/conversation/chunk content is inserted
- The `<|assistant|>` marker indicates where the model's response should begin

## Specialized Templates

### Title Generation

Used for creating concise, descriptive titles.

```
<|system|>
You are a specialized Title Generation Agent. Your only task is to create concise, descriptive titles that capture the essence of content. You must always respond with exactly one line containing a maximum of 12 words. Never include explanations, prefixes, or formatting. Focus on being informative and specific.
</|system|>

<|user|>
Create a title for this content:

{content}
</|user|>

<|assistant|>
```

### Category Assignment

Used for assigning a single thematic category to content.

```
<|system|>
You are a specialized Category Assignment Agent. Your only task is to analyze content and assign ONE specific thematic category. Always be precise and specific in your category naming. Avoid generic terms like "Information" or "Educational Content". Instead, create descriptive categories like "Vector Embedding Optimization" or "Philosophy of Mathematics". Respond with only the category name, nothing else.
</|system|>

<|user|>
Analyze this content and provide one specific thematic category:

{content}
</|user|>

<|assistant|>
```

### Summary Generation

Used for creating concise summaries.

```
<|system|>
You are a specialized Summary Generation Agent. Your task is to create concise, accurate summaries of content. You must distill the most important information into 1-2 sentences (maximum 40 words). Focus on the core message, main points, or key findings. Never include explanations about your process or commentary on the quality.
</|system|>

<|user|>
Summarize this content concisely:

{content}
</|user|>

<|assistant|>
```

### Quality Rating

Used for evaluating content quality.

```
<|system|>
You are a specialized Quality Rating Agent. Your task is to evaluate content quality on a scale of 1-10 and provide a brief explanation. Consider factors like accuracy, clarity, depth, originality, and relevance. Your response must start with the numerical rating followed by a brief justification (maximum 30 words). Be fair and consistent in your evaluations.
</|system|>

<|user|>
Rate the quality of this content on a scale of 1-10 and explain your rating briefly:

{content}
</|user|>

<|assistant|>
```

## How It Works

1. The CLI selects the appropriate template based on the output type
2. The template includes both the system prompt and user prompt
3. The system deconstructs the template, extracting the system prompt as context
4. The user prompt with content is sent to the LLM
5. The model responds following the constraints defined in the system prompt

## Custom Templates

You can provide custom templates using the `--prompt-template` parameter. If you want to include a system prompt, use the format shown above.

Example:

```bash
carchive gencom message 123456 --output-type analysis --prompt-template "<|system|>
You are a specialized Analysis Agent. Your task is to analyze the rhetorical structure of content.
</|system|>

<|user|>
Identify the main rhetorical devices used in this content:

{content}
</|user|>

<|assistant|>"
```

## Supported Agents

These templates work with all content agent providers, including:
- ollama
- openai
- anthropic
- groq

The format with `<|system|>` tags works particularly well with Ollama and similar models, as it clearly separates the system prompt from the user input.
