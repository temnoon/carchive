Below is a high-level map of the main classes, modules, and methods across the carchive2 codebase, along with where they live, what they enable, and how they’re typically used. This gives a bird’s-eye view for anyone intending to build a more optimized CLI, a Node.js/TypeScript interface, or a Flask-based UI.

1. Agents (Embedding/Chat)

Where: carchive2/agents/

1.1 BaseAgent
	•	File: carchive2/agents/base.py
	•	Purpose: An abstract base class (ABC) defining two core methods:
	•	generate_embedding(text: str) -> List[float]
	•	chat(prompt: str, context: Optional[str] = None) -> str
	•	Used By: Other agent classes (OpenAIAgent, OllamaAgent, etc.) must implement these methods.
	•	Imported In: manager.py and other modules needing to instantiate an agent.

1.2 Specific Agent Implementations
	•	OpenAIAgent (openai_agent.py):
	•	Implements the base methods using the OpenAI API (openai.Embedding.create and openai.ChatCompletion.create).
	•	Uses Pydantic for response validation (OpenAIEmbeddingResponse, etc.).
	•	NomicTextEmbedAgent (nomic_text_embed_agent.py):
	•	Hits a local (or remote) Ollama server for “nomic-embed-text” embeddings.
	•	Validates responses with a small Pydantic model (NomicEmbeddingResponse).
	•	OllamaAgent & OllamaChatAgent:
	•	Connect to an Ollama server for either embeddings or chat completions.
	•	Llama32TextAgent (llama32_text_agent.py):
	•	A specialized local agent for text completions using a “3B” Llama model, but currently no embedding support.

Key Takeaway:
Agents let you pick which embedding or chat model to use. AgentManager can return the appropriate agent instance given a provider name.

2. AgentManager

Where: carchive2/agents/manager.py
	•	Class: AgentManager
	•	Purpose:
	•	Provides a simple get_agent(provider: str) -> BaseAgent method that returns an instance of the correct agent class (OpenAI, Ollama, etc.).
	•	Pulls in config values like API keys from carchive2.core.config.
	•	Usage:
	•	Often used by embedding routines or chat endpoints. The CLI might say --provider openai, then the code calls AgentManager().get_agent("openai") to fetch OpenAIAgent.

3. Database Models & Session

Where: carchive2/database/

3.1 models.py
	•	Classes:
	•	Conversation: Holds conversation-level data (title, meta_info, etc.).
	•	Message: Tied to a conversation; stores text content & meta_info.
	•	Chunk: Optional splits of large messages.
	•	Embedding: Vector data from pgvector, referencing a message or chunk.
	•	Collection / CollectionItem: Grouping objects for sets of messages/chunks.
	•	Relationships:
	•	Conversation ←→ Message, Message ←→ Chunk, Collection ←→ CollectionItem.
	•	Used By:
	•	Ingestion, search, collections, rendering, etc.

3.2 session.py
	•	Function: get_session()
	•	A context manager that yields a SQLAlchemy session:

with get_session() as session:
    # do DB operations


	•	Used By:
	•	All modules that need DB access (search, ingestion, etc.).

4. Ingestion (Importers)

Where:
	•	carchive2/ingestion/ingest.py
	•	(Legacy or partial) ingestion/ingest_old.py

4.1 ingest_file(...)
	•	Logic:
	•	Detect JSON vs. ZIP file.
	•	Parse out conversations/messages (and potentially attachments).
	•	Insert them into the DB with session logic.
	•	Schemas:
	•	ConversationEntry & RawMessage (simple Pydantic models) validate partial JSON structures.
	•	Possible Future:
	•	Reorganize into an importers/ folder with a BaseImporter if you want specialized importers for ChatGPT, Facebook, etc.

Usage:
	•	By the CLI command carchive ingest file <path> or in scripts that want to import chat data.

5. Search

Where: carchive2/search/search.py

5.1 Functions
	•	search_conversations(query, limit) → returns [ConversationRead]
	•	search_messages(query, limit) → returns [MessageRead]
	•	search_messages_with_conversation(query, limit) → returns [MessageWithConversationRead]
	•	A specialized joined query that yields both message + minimal conversation info in a Pydantic model.
	•	vector_search(anchor_vector, top_k) → returns a list of Embedding SQLAlchemy objects.
	•	create_collection_from_vector(name, anchor_vector, top_k) → creates a new Collection based on the top-k embeddings.

5.2 Pydantic “Read” Models
	•	MessageRead, ConversationRead, etc. in carchive2/schemas/db_objects.py.
	•	Ensures typed data is returned from DB queries.

Used By:
	•	The CLI (search_cli.py subcommands).
	•	Potential future frontends or APIs for searching.

6. Embeddings

Where: carchive2/embeddings/

6.1 embed.py
	•	Function: embed_text(text, provider, model_version)
	•	Creates an agent via AgentManager, generates an embedding, stores in DB.

6.2 embed_manager.py
	•	Class: EmbeddingManager
	•	Method: embed_texts(request_data: EmbeddingRequestSchema) -> List[EmbeddingResultSchema]
	•	More flexible: can embed raw text or references to a message/ chunk.

Used By:
	•	The CLI (embed_cli.py).
	•	Possibly advanced search pipelines that want to generate embeddings on the fly.

7. Collections

Where: carchive2/collections/

7.1 collection_manager.py
	•	create_collection(...): Takes CollectionCreateSchema and persists a new Collection + items.
	•	update_collection, list_collections, etc.: Basic DB operations for collections.
	•	create_collection_from_dbobjects(...): Accepts a heterogeneous list of Pydantic objects (e.g. messages, conversations) and auto-creates CollectionItems pointing to them.

7.2 schemas.py
	•	CollectionCreateSchema, CollectionItemSchema: Pydantic definitions for building/updating collections.

Used By:
	•	The CLI subcommands for collections (create, list, render).
	•	Potentially other modules that want to group sets of messages or embeddings.

8. Rendering

Where: carchive2/collections/render_engine.py + carchive2/rendering/conversation_renderer.py

8.1 render_collection_to_html(...)
	•	Iterates over each CollectionItem, loads the relevant Message or Chunk, and produces styled HTML.
	•	Optionally includes conversation metadata or message metadata.

8.2 render_conversation_to_html(...)
	•	Similar approach, but for a single conversation.

Used By:
	•	The CLI commands (collection_cli.py, render_cli.py) for HTML exports.
	•	Could be reused or extended in a future pipeline for PDF or more advanced export.

9. CLI

Where: carchive2/cli/

9.1 Subcommand Modules
	•	ingestion_cli.py → carchive ingest file <path>
	•	search_cli.py → carchive search messages <query>, etc.
	•	embed_cli.py → carchive embed text "<some text>"
	•	collection_cli.py → carchive collection create --name ...
	•	render_cli.py → carchive render conversation ...

9.2 Aggregation
	•	main_cli.py
	•	Combines all subcommands into a single Typer app (main_app).

Used By:
	•	Developer or user command line.
	•	Eventually, you could replicate these calls in a Node/TypeScript environment or a Flask route if you want an HTTP interface.

10. (Potential) Pipeline Code

Where: carchive2/pipelines/
	•	search_pipeline.py → A SearchPipeline class that can chain steps for advanced multi-stage filtering or ranking.
	•	steps/ folder (if used) might hold small classes like TextFilterStep, MetaFilterStep, EmbeddingStep, etc.

Why:
This is optional if you want advanced AI or multi-criteria searches. Each step is a mini “transform” that receives and returns data or lists of Pydantic objects.

11. How These Components Can Expose an API or GUI

Because each domain (ingestion, search, embeddings, etc.) is handled in a separate Python module or manager, you can do any of the following:
	1.	Node.js / TypeScript
	•	Write a small wrapper that calls Python code via:
	•	Subprocess (call the CLI commands).
	•	Directly if you embed a Python server and call it via HTTP or an IPC mechanism.
	•	Then your Node app can pass requests (like “search for messages” or “ingest this file”) to carchive2.
	2.	Flask or FastAPI
	•	You can create an API that calls these manager classes.
	•	For instance, a Flask route /api/search/messages?query=foo could internally do:

results = search_messages(query="foo", limit=10)
return jsonify([r.dict() for r in results])


	•	Another route /api/conversation/render?id=XYZ could call render_conversation_to_html.

	3.	GUI
	•	If you build a React, Vue, or Svelte front-end, it can talk to the Flask/Node API endpoints.
	•	The logic for searching, embedding, or rendering remains in Python, only the user interface moves to the JavaScript side.
	4.	MCP or Another AI Protocol
	•	Because your code is already modular (especially if you keep the CLI thin), hooking into an external protocol (e.g., Anthropic’s MCP) is mostly about bridging the method calls.

12. Ideal Architecture for the Future
	1.	Core “Service” Classes
	•	Agents, Database Models, Ingestion, Search, and Collections remain the stable core.
	•	They are manager-based or pipeline-based so that logic is in Python, not the CLI or UI code.
	2.	Decoupled CLI
	•	The CLI is simply a front-end to these managers. If you want to present a second interface (a Flask server or a Node-based GraphQL API), you just wrap the same managers.
	3.	Unified Data Models
	•	Pydantic read schemas for external consumption.
	•	Pydantic create/update schemas for ingestion and collection creation.
	•	Clear boundaries ensure data is validated at each step.
	4.	Optional Pipeline Steps
	•	For advanced search or exporting, you chain “steps” that transform or filter data. The final result can be turned into a collection or returned to the user.
	5.	API or Node Integration
	•	Build a REST or GraphQL interface calling the same manager methods.
	•	The front-end (React, Vue, or a native mobile app) calls those endpoints, letting users do ingestion, search, embedding, or exporting from a browser or separate GUI.

Summary
	•	Modules & Classes:
	•	Agents → Provide either embedding or chat endpoints.
	•	Database → SQLAlchemy models + session. Ties everything to PostgreSQL.
	•	Ingestion → A function or potential “BaseImporter” for reading archives.
	•	Search → Functions returning Pydantic “read” models. Possibly pipeline-based.
	•	Embeddings → Agent-based embedding, stored in the embeddings table.
	•	Collections → A manager and schemas to group messages/chunks.
	•	Rendering → HTML output for collections or conversations.
	•	CLI → Typer-based commands for each domain.

Everything is modular so you can easily wrap it in:
	•	CLI (already done),
	•	Flask (simple route layer calling the same managers),
	•	Node (call the Python code or an HTTP API),
	•	or any other automation layer.

This big-picture structure ensures carchive2 can scale from a local CLI ingestion tool to a multi-user server-based app with a GUI, while reusing the same manager classes and Pydantic models for reliability and consistency.
